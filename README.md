# About the repository

![preview image](./splash-preview.png)

A partial clone of the Paypal Android Mobile App with only the basic functionality to switch between pages using Tab and Stack Navigation - and built with React Native Expo.

NOTE: This is not a replacement for the Paypal App.

## How to run

1. Clone the repository using `git-clone REPOSITORY_NAME`
2. Run `npm install` in the work directory and then run `npm start` to start an Android Emulator. Look at the `package.json` file for more scripts.

- If you encounter any issues, please go through the Expo Documentation, StackOverflow, Android Studio Docs, GitHub Issues and Google - before opening an issue on the repo. Thank you :)

## Features

1. Stack Navigation.
2. Tab Navigation.

## Issues

1. I've updated the splash screen but for some reason it won't update in the app. If you're willing
